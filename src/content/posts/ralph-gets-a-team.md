Last week I wrote about [running Claude Code in a bash loop](/posts/ralph-loops). One agent, one task file, a PM that kept sneaking off to write React components. Charming chaos.

Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 yesterday, and with it, sub-agents: multiple agents with distinct roles running inside a single session. The PM plans. Ralph builds. A third agent reviews. One window instead of two.

In the old setup, the PM wouldn’t stay in its lane because you were asking it nicely not to code. Now the PM literally cannot run code. No Bash access. “Please don’t” became “you can’t.” 

I’m sure there are many engineers who would love to play that card on their vibe happy PM!
