I'm David Larpent, Chief Product Officer at Lavanda, a property technology company.

I write about product strategy, AI, and the intersection of technology with how we actually live and work. Sometimes I paint. Occasionally I make music, badly.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlarpent) or don't. I'm not precious about it.
