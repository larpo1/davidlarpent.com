I'm David Larpent, CPO at [Lavanda](https://getlavanda.com), a property technology company.

I write these notes to help me organise my thoughts on anything I find interesting: product strategy, software engineering, AI, philosophy and cognitive science. 

Sometimes I paint. Occasionally I make music, badly.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlarpent) or Substack.
