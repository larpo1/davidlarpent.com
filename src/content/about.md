I'm David Larpent, CPO at [Lavanda](https://getlavanda.com), a property technology company.

Sometimes I paint. Occasionally I make music, badly.

These notes are mostly to help me. If they also help you, great! They include thoughts product strategy, software engineering, AI, philosophy and cognitive science. 

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlarpent) or Substack.
