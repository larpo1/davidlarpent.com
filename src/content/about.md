I'm David Larpent, CPO at [Lavanda](https://getlavanda.com), a property technology company.

This site is an exercise is activated reading and listening, because I only retain stuff once I have written my thoughts down. [These notes are mostly to help me.](https://davidlarpent.com/posts/what-we-lose-when-we-stop-struggling) If they also help you, great! They include thoughts on product strategy, software engineering, AI, agentic coding, philosophy and cognitive science.
