There is an unspoken compact in open source that effort in the submission is met with effort in the review. The surge in low-effort, and often low-value AI generated open source contributions is breaks the compact.

The flood of Claude-generated PRs is causing a lot of pain in the open source community and an inevitable backlash reaction. Where does this lead? Blanket rejection of AI contributions to open source projects is also not the answer.

On “harness engineering”. When you see AI do a bad thing, try to build tooling it could have called out to avoid or course correct away from that bad thing.

Always have an agent running in the background because there is always something to do. Disable its ability to notify you: remain in control of interruptions. You choose when to interrupt the agent.

"Rejecting AI before spending serious time with it ...is like trying git for an hour and deciding you’re not more productive with it."
