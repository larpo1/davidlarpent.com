      <p>
        I'm David Larpent, Chief Product Officer at Lavanda, a property technology company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write about product strategy, AI, and the intersection of technology with how we actually live and work. Sometimes I paint. Occasionally I make music, badly.

        Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlarpent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> or don't. I'm not precious about it.
