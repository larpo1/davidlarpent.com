# Writer Agent Memory

## Voice Calibration Notes

### Key voice markers from existing posts (ranked by importance)
1. **Short sentences as punchlines.** The short sentence lands the point. "I've been playing with this. It's amusing." "Progress." "Plenty."
2. **Self-deprecating humour through specificity.** Not "I find this amusing" but "which is the kind of spending pattern that feels rational in the moment and questionable in the shower afterwards."
3. **Wry anthropomorphism of AI agents.** Ralph "sighs and does more work." The PM "couldn't help itself." Treat agents as characters with mild personality flaws.
4. **Ironic self-awareness.** The author frequently notes the irony of his own behaviour (writing about struggle while using AI, tinkering with setup instead of measuring productivity).
5. **Physical/concrete metaphors only.** "The lane has walls." "Shoves it back in the room." Never abstract literary metaphors.

### Opening patterns that work
- Ironic callback to another post ("This particular rabbit hole might seem ironic, given...")
- Plain declarative ("I wrote this the old fashioned way.")
- Drop into the middle of an argument ("Every organisation hits a ceiling...")
- Never: rhetorical questions, "In today's..." preambles

### Closing patterns that work
- Forward-looking understatement ("I suspect this is a preview of something.")
- Quiet declaration ("That advantage compounds.")
- Callback to the post's own theme with slight twist

### The "not-work" register vs "work" register
- not-work: More vulnerable, more self-deprecation, footnotes for citations, conversational
- work: More structured, inline links, evidence-based, practical
- Both share sentence rhythm and directness

## Revision Patterns

### Common draft problems to watch for
- Sections that read like product descriptions (fix: add what it *felt like*, not what it *does*)
- Generic headers like "Memory that lasts" (fix: make them declarative/punchy: "Writing rules for a machine")
- Consultant-speak that sneaks in ("structural constraints", "institutional memory") (fix: either cut or immediately undercut with humour)
- Flat endings (fix: callback to earlier post or theme, quiet landing)

### Things the voice rules don't capture but the posts show
- The author refers to agents by name ("Ralph") as if they're people on a team
- Footnotes in not-work posts often contain the driest humour
- The author is comfortable saying "I don't know" and leaving questions genuinely open

## Revision Lessons

### ralph-gets-a-team.md rewrite (2026-02-06)
- Author's instinct: shorter is better. Original was ~800 words, author wanted 400-500.
- Whole sections can be cut if they drift from the core narrative (writer agent/voice rules sections were interesting but diluted the piece).
- The author explicitly does NOT want the writer agent mentioned in published posts. Keep the fourth wall intact.
- Best lines from originals should be preserved verbatim when compressing ("rational in the moment and questionable in the shower afterwards").
- When a new model/capability drops, anchor the post in that timeliness ("yesterday", "twelve hours", "one day old").

## Post Relationships
- `ralph-loops.md` -> `ralph-gets-a-team.md` (sequel, direct callbacks)
- `what-we-lose-when-we-stop-struggling.md` referenced from both Ralph posts (ironic tension)
- `when-decisions-stop-scaling.md` -> `decision-systems.md` -> `ai-data-architecture.md` (work series)
