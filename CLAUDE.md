- [x] **Fix TOC toggle button - currently invisible when TOC is open**
      - **Critical Bug:** Toggle button is hidden when TOC is open on desktop (display: none)
      - **Impact:** Users cannot close an open TOC - button disappears, functionality broken
      - **Root cause:** Tried to fix overlap by hiding button, but removed close functionality

      - **Why tests didn't catch this:**
        - Test was written to VALIDATE the bug: `await expect(toggle).not.toBeVisible()`
        - Test verified implementation (button hidden) instead of behavior (user can close TOC)
        - Need to test USER NEEDS not implementation details

      - **Correct Solution Options:**

        **Option 1: Always-visible TOC on desktop (RECOMMENDED)**
        - On desktop (>1200px): TOC is permanently visible, no close button needed
        - On mobile/tablet: Keep toggle for overlay behavior
        - Simplest, matches minimalist design philosophy
        - CSS: Remove ability to close on desktop, keep hamburger visible only on small screens

        **Option 2: Move toggle when open**
        - When TOC opens, slide toggle to the right (e.g., `left: 300px`)
        - Sits next to TOC instead of overlapping
        - More complex animation

        **Option 3: Bring back X inside TOC**
        - Add close button in TOC header next to "CONTENTS"
        - Toggle button opens, X button closes
        - More elements to manage

      - **Recommended Implementation (Option 1):**
        ```css
        /* Desktop: TOC always visible, toggle always hidden */
        @media (min-width: 1201px) {
          .toc-toggle {
            display: none; /* No toggle needed on desktop */
          }

          .toc-container {
            display: block !important; /* Always visible */
          }

          .toc-container[data-open="false"] {
            display: block !important; /* Override - always show */
          }
        }

        /* Mobile/tablet: Keep toggle functionality */
        @media (max-width: 1200px) {
          .toc-toggle {
            display: flex; /* Show toggle */
          }

          .toc-container[data-open="false"] {
            display: none; /* Hide when closed */
          }
        }
        ```

      - **Update JavaScript:**
        - Disable toggle click handler on desktop
        - Only allow toggle on mobile/tablet widths

      - **Fix the test:**
        ```javascript
        test('user can always see TOC on desktop', async ({ page }) => {
          await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1400, height: 800 });
          // TOC should always be visible
          const toc = page.locator('.toc-container');
          await expect(toc).toBeVisible();

          // Toggle button should not exist on desktop
          const toggle = page.locator('.toc-toggle');
          await expect(toggle).not.toBeVisible();
        });
        ```

      - **Files to modify:**
        - `src/styles/global.css` - Media query logic
        - `src/components/TableOfContents.astro` - JavaScript to disable toggle on desktop
        - `tests/toc.spec.ts` - Fix test to verify behavior not implementation

      - **Test:**
        1. Desktop (>1200px): TOC always visible, no toggle button
        2. Mobile (<1200px): Toggle works to open/close overlay
        3. No overlap, no broken functionality

      - Commit: `fix: Make TOC always visible on desktop, toggle for mobile only`

- [x] **Fix TOC toggle button issues (overlap + animation quality)**
      - **Issue 1:** X button overlaps with "CONTENTS" text when TOC is open (both at same position)
      - **Issue 2:** Animation is not as smooth/elegant as reference material

      - **Problem with current animation:**
        - Bars use flexbox `gap: 5px` - not precise enough
        - translateY values (7px/-7px) create imprecise movement
        - Bars don't rotate around a common center point
        - Basic `ease` timing function is not as elegant
        - Bars don't meet perfectly at center to form clean X

      - **Solution for animation:**
        1. Remove flexbox gap, use absolute positioning for bars
        2. Position bars relative to button center
        3. Use `transform-origin: center` so bars rotate around common point
        4. Use refined easing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`
        5. Bars should translate to exact center, then rotate

      - **Updated CSS structure:**
        ```css
        .toc-toggle {
          position: relative; /* for absolute bar positioning */
          width: 2rem;
          height: 2rem;
          /* Remove gap and flex alignment */
        }

        .toc-toggle .bar {
          position: absolute;
          left: 50%;
          transform: translateX(-50%);
          width: 1.5rem;
          height: 2px;
          transition: transform 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1),
                      opacity 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
        }

        .toc-toggle .bar:nth-child(1) {
          top: 25%; /* Top position */
        }

        .toc-toggle .bar:nth-child(2) {
          top: 50%; /* Center */
          transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
        }

        .toc-toggle .bar:nth-child(3) {
          top: 75%; /* Bottom position */
        }

        /* When open - bars meet at center and rotate */
        .toc-toggle.open .bar:nth-child(1) {
          top: 50%;
          transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%) rotate(45deg);
        }

        .toc-toggle.open .bar:nth-child(2) {
          opacity: 0;
        }

        .toc-toggle.open .bar:nth-child(3) {
          top: 50%;
          transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%) rotate(-45deg);
        }
        ```

      - **Solution for overlap:**
        ```css
        /* Hide toggle when TOC is open on desktop */
        @media (min-width: 1201px) {
          .toc-toggle.open {
            display: none;
          }
        }
        ```

      - **Files to modify:** `src/styles/global.css`
      - **Test:**
        1. Toggle multiple times - animation should feel buttery smooth
        2. Bars should form perfect X at button center
        3. On desktop: X should disappear when TOC open (no overlap)
      - Commit: `refactor: Improve hamburger animation and fix overlap`

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **Polish TOC toggle buttons (hamburger/X)** ⚠️ UX REFINEMENT
      - **Issues:**
        1. Hamburger button has 1px border - remove it
        2. X and hamburger should be in exactly the same place (not jump positions)
        3. X should smoothly animate/morph into hamburger (elegant transition)
      - **Reference animation:** https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/from-hamburger-to-close-icon-a-webflow-animation-journey-c88a06632ab9
        - Three-bar hamburger morphs into X
        - Top/bottom bars rotate and translate to form X
        - Middle bar fades out
        - Smooth, elegant CSS animation
      - **Files to modify:**
        - `src/styles/global.css` - remove border from `.toc-toggle`, add animation styles
        - `src/components/TableOfContents.astro` - restructure button to use spans for bars
      - **Implementation approach:**
        - Use single button with three `<span>` bars inside
        - CSS transitions on transform (rotate, translate) and opacity
        - Toggle class on button (e.g., `.toc-toggle.open`) to trigger animation
        - Remove `border: 1px solid var(--color-border)`
      - **Example structure:**
        ```html
        <button class="toc-toggle">
          <span class="bar"></span>
          <span class="bar"></span>
          <span class="bar"></span>
        </button>
        ```
      - **Test:** Toggle TOC open/close multiple times, verify smooth morph animation like reference
      - Commit: `refactor: Add smooth hamburger-to-X animation, remove border`

## Testing Standards

### When to Run Tests
- After any CSS changes
- After modifying TOC component
- Before committing UI changes
- After updating dependencies

### What to Do If Tests Fail
1. Check the error message and stack trace
2. Review screenshots in `test-results/` if visual test
3. Fix the issue or update baselines with `npm run test:update`
4. Re-run tests to confirm fix

### Test Commands
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests headless
npm run test:headed   # Run with visible browser
npm run test:ui       # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:update   # Update baseline screenshots
```

---

## Standards

### Code Style
- TypeScript, Astro components
- Keep it simple. This is a blog, not a SaaS product.
- No unnecessary dependencies

### Git
- Commit after each completed task
- Commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`
- Never commit if `npm run build` fails

### Design
- Minimal. Think darioamodei.com
- Dark mode default, light mode available
- No animations, no hero images, no noise
- Typography is the design

---

## Architecture Decisions

- **Newsreader font:** Chosen for readability on long essays. Don't change.
- **Dark mode default:** Intentional. Don't change.
- **No analytics yet:** Will add Plausible later if needed.
- **No comments:** Intentional. Not a community, just essays.

## PM Review Notes

### 2026-01-30: TOC Toggle - Critical Bug After Attempted Fix
**Status:** Ralph's fix for overlap created a worse bug - X button now invisible, users can't close TOC

**What Happened:**
1. ✅ Animation improved (absolute positioning, cubic-bezier, bars meet at center)
2. ❌ Fixed overlap by hiding toggle when open (`display: none`)
3. ❌ **NEW CRITICAL BUG:** Users cannot close TOC on desktop - button is gone!
4. ❌ Test validated the bug instead of catching it

**Why Tests Failed to Catch This:**
- Ralph wrote test that asserts `toggle.not.toBeVisible()` - testing the broken implementation
- Test should verify "user can close TOC", not "button is hidden"
- Classic case: testing implementation details instead of user behavior

**The Real Issue:**
- We don't need a toggle on desktop - TOC should be always-visible
- Toggle is only needed for mobile/tablet overlay mode
- Trying to have one button do double-duty (open/close) on all screen sizes is overcomplicating

**Correct Solution:**
- Desktop: TOC permanently visible, no toggle button at all
- Mobile/Tablet: Toggle button controls overlay
- Simpler, matches minimalist design, no overlap possible

---

## Decision Log

### 2026-01-30: TOC Positioning
**Issue:** TOC needed to work on desktop sidebar and mobile overlay
**Solution:** Used fixed positioning to viewport, separate from content flow
**Outcome:** 72 Playwright tests pass including overlap detection
**Lesson:** Position TOC outside content flow to maintain proper content width

### 2026-01-30: Playwright Integration
**Why:** Need automated testing to catch TOC positioning issues
**Trade-offs:** Adds ~3MB to dev dependencies, requires browser downloads
**Outcome:** Comprehensive test coverage for TOC functional and visual behavior

### 2026-01-30: Test-Driven Bug - Toggle Button Hidden
**Issue:** Ralph hid toggle button when TOC open to fix overlap, broke close functionality
**Why tests didn't catch it:** Test validated the implementation (`expect(toggle).not.toBeVisible()`) instead of testing user behavior ("can user close the TOC?")
**Lesson:** Tests must verify USER NEEDS and BEHAVIORS, not implementation details
**Example of bad test:** Asserting button is hidden
**Example of good test:** Verifying user can complete the open/close cycle
**Fix:** TOC should be always-visible on desktop (no toggle needed), toggle only for mobile overlay

## Notes From Human

This is a learning exercise for Ralph loops. The tasks are real but low-stakes. Don't overthink it.
